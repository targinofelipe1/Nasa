## 👥 About the Team

Hello, we are Team Pindorama!
Inspired by the ancestral name given to Brazil before colonization, Pindorama represents for us the idea of a fertile, diverse land full of possibilities — just like our team.

We are a multidisciplinary group, combining expertise in technology, geography, and international relations to transform data into knowledge and solutions that connect people and territories.

Coming from the Northeast of Brazil, we bring the strength, creativity, and joy of our region.
We are competing in the NASA Space Apps Challenge with focus, enthusiasm, and purpose: to innovate, inspire, and contribute to a more sustainable and accessible future through data storytelling.

Just as Pindorama symbolizes origin and renewal, we believe in the power of uniting science, culture, and technology to create new stories and transform realities.

## 🌆 Project Description

Global Life Cities (GLC) is a platform that connects society, government, researchers, and companies around a common goal: to build more sustainable, intelligent, and resilient cities.

The tool translates complex data from NASA and other scientific sources into accessible and actionable information, helping urban planners and citizens make evidence-based decisions.

Through the VMAP method — Visualize, Map, Monitor, and Plan — GLC allows users to:

Visualize environmental and urban indicators (temperature, pollution, vegetation cover, precipitation, etc.);

Map vulnerable areas and prioritize sustainable interventions;

Monitor progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs);

Plan public policies and community actions based on real and updated data.

## 🧠 How It Works

The platform enables natural language queries, such as:

“Which neighborhoods showed the highest surface temperatures last summer, and where should we prioritize new green areas?”

In seconds, the system queries multiple databases and returns graphs, maps, and predictive insights, facilitating urban planning and public transparency.

In addition to supporting policymakers and researchers, GLC democratizes access to information, allowing any citizen to actively participate in building a fairer and more sustainable urban future.

## 🌱 Impact

Democratizes access to environmental data from NASA and INPE;

Prevents climate disasters, such as floods and heat islands;

Strengthens citizen participation and social control over public policies;

Promotes open science and data for sustainable development;

Supports the creation of urban and climate resilience policies.

## 🛰️ Technologies and Data Sources

NASA Earth Data & GEE (Google Earth Engine)

INPE – Image and meteorological data catalog

INMET – National Institute of Meteorology

MapBiomas – Land use and land cover

ICMBio – Environmental and biodiversity data

WWF Brazil, CPRM, SEMAM (JP-PB)

## 💡 Use Cases

GLC can:

Alert about hydrological risk zones based on precipitation data;

Detect urban heat islands and suggest priority areas for reforestation;

Integrate academic research into real public policies;

Track SDG progress (especially SDG 11 — Sustainable Cities and Communities).

## 🧩 Conceptual Framework

The project is supported by studies in urban planning, critical geography, and sustainability, based on authors such as:

Milton Santos

David Harvey

Roberto Lobato Corrêa

Marcelo Lopes de Souza

Yigitcanlar and Lonnqvist

These references reinforce the role of knowledge as the driving force behind sustainable urban development.

## 🧭 Future and Expansion

Partnerships with public institutions and NGOs for tool adoption;

Integration with georeferencing systems and local sensors;

Collaboration network with universities, promoting applied research;

Focus on regional SDGs, connecting companies and communities in sustainable projects.

## 🚀 Conclusion

Global Life Cities proposes a new paradigm for urban planning:
data, science, and empathy as the foundation for human and sustainable decisions.

More than a monitoring system, it is a living platform that connects people, territories, and information to transform local realities into global stories of resilience.
